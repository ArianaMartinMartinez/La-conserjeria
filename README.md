# The Concierge üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏èüè®

In this project the objective is to create a CRUD using only PHP, HTML (integrated), CSS and SQL queries to store and display the incidents that occurred in a hotel.
The CRUD is integrated into a table maintaining an external button to add new data. Which are: room number, incidents, area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel where they happen, and date.

## Installation Guide

0Ô∏è‚É£ The first step before doing the proyect is to design how the database is going to be structured; For this we have used [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/), generating this table in the process that we will use as a template.

</p>

1Ô∏è‚É£ Once the structure is defined, we will need a database manager and a php interpreter; For this project [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html) has been used, but it can be chosen according to the user's preferences.

2Ô∏è‚É£ In our database manager, we create a database called "Concierge", and then we import the following file, which will offer us a table called "problems" with the parameters seen in the image below.

</p>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Now we must download the repository; We can download the files directly from github, or clone the repository through the terminal using this command:
`git clone https://github.com/ArianaMartinMartinez/La-conserjeria.git`


4Ô∏è‚É£ Once the project is installed, we must install it in the vendor root folder, using the command:
`composer install`

5Ô∏è‚É£ When our Apache server and our database management system are started, we can access the project using the browser url. For this project it will be:
`http://localhost/La-conserjeria/index.php`
